# Overview

For this challenge, I used Machine Learning and Neural Networks. The reason for this challenge was to create a binary classifier that will help to predict the future applicants that will be funded by a Charitable organization called Alphabet Soup. For this project, we had a dataset that contain various measures of different organizations that have been funded by Alphabet Soup.

# Results

-	What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 

*IS_SUCCESSFUL* 

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features of your model?

*Every Column except for IS_SUCCESSFUL*

-What variable(s) were neither targets nor features for the dataset?

*EIN and NAME because they will have no impact on our outcome*

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

-How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did I select for my neural network model?

For my neural network model, I chose :
- 2 hidden layers and the first layer had 80 neurons
- the second layer has 30 there is also an output layer.
